Do you think you don't have enough weaponary in your arsenal? Craft the autohammer and combine two bars together to get a stronger material for your armor, weapons and tools! Pretty [c/eeccaa:Oresome], don't you think? Also, this mod gives a little bit of love to the mixed class by giving it more armor pieces to choose from when entering Hardmode (Coming Soon).
