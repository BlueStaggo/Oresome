# Oresome!

Do you think you don't have enough weaponary in your arsenal? Craft the autohammer and combine two bars together to get a stronger material for your armor, weapons and tools! Pretty Oresome, don't you think? Also, this mod gives a little bit of love to the mixed class by giving it more armor pieces to choose from when entering Hardmode (Coming Soon).

## PRE-HARDMODE
- Bronze (Copper + Tin)
- Steel (Iron + Lead)
- Osmite (Silver + Tungsten)
- Iridium (Gold + Platinum)

## COMING SOON
- Kryptonite (Demonite + Crimtane)
- Argonite (Hellstone + Meteorite)
- Rhodinite (Cobalt + Palladium)
- Neptunium (Mythril + Orichalcum)
- Scandite (Adamantite + Titanium)
- Vacuolite (Chlorophyte + Spectre + Shroomite)

## Planned features:
* Ability to place bars
* Give love to mixed
